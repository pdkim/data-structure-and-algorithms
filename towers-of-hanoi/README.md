# Tower of Hanoi
Create a function that moves a set of "discs" from one column to another column.  All discs start on the left column and must use a middle and right column until all columns are back in order they started.

## Challenge
- declare a number of discs greater than 0.  If 0, notify user they need to enter a valid number.
- create 3 columns or stacks
- check if column has a disk
  - if there is a disc, is it larger than the current disc?
    - if it is, move disc to any different column, else place in that column
- log every move
- all discs should be on the right column in the same order as it started
